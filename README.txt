If you want the references to just "work", then pull the solution down to C:\Git\.

Otherwise, set your own references. =P

You will need to set connection strings to your db.

Db should create itself when you first run the app.  (Code first)

Only concern yourself with the /People/ url.  This can be reached at /

Cheers
